- **Routing**: Angular Router with lazy loading

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing
- **Middleware**: CORS, authentication, role-based authorization
- **API**: RESTful API with comprehensive error handling

## üîß Technical Workflows

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User submits credentials
2. Backend validates credentials
3. JWT token generated with user role
4. Token stored in localStorage
5. AuthInterceptor adds token to requests
6. AuthGuard protects routes based on role
7. Token expiry handled gracefully
```

### API Request Flow
```
